        <h1>The Ethiopian Legend or Origins<br> in Yemen?</h1>
        <p>Ethiopia is often regarded as the birthplace of coffee. If you've ever searched for "coffee history," you've likely encountered the well-known tale of coffee's origin in Ethiopia, attributed to Kaldi, an Ethiopian goat herder, around the year 800 AD.</p>
        <p>There are also a few well-known stories about Yemen’s contribution in the founding of coffee. It’s later largely believed that Yemeni traders brought coffee plants back to their homeland and began to grow them there.</p>

        <h1>The New World and Coffee Plantation</h1>
        <p>Growing coffee in Europe was a struggle, due to its naturally colder climates. The New World's hot, tropical weather was seen as a new ideal for the cultivation of coffee, and coffee plantations quickly spread throughout Central America and Latin America, with their first coffee harvest occurring in 1726.</p>
        <p>In the mid-18th century, Latin American nations transformed into leading coffee producers, capable of clearing vast tropical forests to establish plantations. Today, Brazil stands as the world's largest coffee producer.</p>

        <h1>The Bean Belt</h1>
        <p>Over 2.25 billion cups of coffee are consumed in the world daily. Nearly 70 coffee-producing countries, spanning various continents, are situated along an imaginary belt known as the coffee bean belt. This belt is positioned between 23.5 degrees north and south latitude and encircles the Earth along the equator. These nations enjoy the advantages of tropical climates, making them ideal environments for coffee cultivation.</p>

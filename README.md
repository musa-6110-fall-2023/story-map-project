## Instructions

### Step 1: Choose a topic

Choose a topic that is fruitfully explained with some combination of narrative and geographic elements. Think about what data you want to tell a story about. Whatever data you use, **be sure to include citations somewhere in your app interface**. You can choose a dataset from any of a number of sources, for example:

* Use data you've been working with for another class
* Create your own dataset (check out [geojson.io](https://geojson.io))
* Find data from an open data repository...

#### OpenDataPhilly.org

OpenDataPhilly has lots of Philadelphia-specific data, like:

- [Neighborhood Boundaries](https://opendataphilly.org/dataset/philadelphia-neighborhoods)
- Historic [Streets](https://opendataphilly.org/dataset/historic-streets), [Districts](https://opendataphilly.org/dataset/philadelphia-registered-historic-districts), or [Properties](https://opendataphilly.org/dataset/philadelphia-registered-historic-sites)
- [School Information](https://opendataphilly.org/dataset/school-information-data)
- [PA Horticultural Society Land Care](https://opendataphilly.org/dataset/land-care)

#### Other open data portals

Many other cities, counties, states, and countries have dedicated data portals as well. Here are a couple of lists of state-sponsored open data sites:

- [Data.gov - Open Government](https://data.gov/open-gov/)
- [Open Knowledge Foundation - DataPortals.org](https://dataportals.org/)

#### Independently compiled data sources

Sources like [Stop Demolishing Philly](https://www.stopdemolishingphilly.com/map/) or other privately compiled data sources.


Use one of the template story maps in the _templates/_ folder, modified as you see fit, to explain your topic.

* At least 5 slides
* Host your site on GitHub Pages

### Step 2: Think About Slide Content

Your story will have multiple slides, each with a title, some additional text, maybe images, and geographic data. Some parts of your slide content will go straight into your HTML, and other parts will go into a JavaScript structure to be placed on your map when the corresponding HTML content is visible.

### Step 3: Submit your story map

Commit your code and push it to your repository on GitHub. Set up GitHub pages on the repository and submit the link to both the GitHub Repository and the live site on GitHub Pages via the assignment on the class Canvas.

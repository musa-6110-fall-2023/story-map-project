          University of Pennsylvania. His interdisciplinary work examines research methodologies 
          that develop and evaluate environmental performance-driven architectural components. 
          In addition, his research asks how passive architectural components, 
          informed by new sustainable materials and advanced digital technologies, 
          improve building performance in response to the current socio-climate contexts.
          Before joining the University of Pennsylvania, Ji Yoon completed
           an MS in Matter Design Computation from Cornell University and an M.Arch from Syracuse University.</p>

        <p><b>NeoBrick</b> is a 3D clay-printed brick prototype
          that explores generative design processes
          coupled with environmental inputs as design
          drivers. Maintaining indoor thermal comfort
          by utilizing a passive cooling strategy contributes
          to energy efficiency and healthy
          indoor air environment in a specific climatic
          context such as tropical climate zones. In this
          aspect, clay is a locally accessible material
          that brings thermal benefits for cooling due to
          the low heat conductivity. Moreover, environmental
          simulations and additive manufacturing
          techniques are emerging as key drivers for
          designing and testing a performance-driven
          architectural systems. <b><i>This paper introduces
          an integrated research workflow that develops
          a Triply Periodic Minimal Surface (TPMS)-
          informed clay-printed brick system. The brick
          geometries are informed by environmental
          feedback including airflow and heat transfer
          performance. </i></b>To articulate this environmentally
          performing clay brick prototype, first,
          this research leverages computational fluid
          dynamics (CFD) and heat transfer analysis to
          inform and evaluate brick geometries. Second,
          the research utilizes an additive manufacturing
          technology with customized toolpaths for
          fabricating non-standard brick geometries.
          Lastly, the research delivers a possible residential
          architectural application in a specific
          climate condition, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam,
          to suggest a possible adaptation of the
          passive ventilation system for enhancing the
          thermal environment and energy efficiency.</p>

        <h2>HoloWall</h2>
        <iframe width="100%" height="315px" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iAzDS8P5vG0?si=gCi5cuH1b42MY2nP" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        
        <p>HoloWall is a wall assembly that integrates mixed reality (MR) protocols with nonuniformly
          sized lumber to develop a customized hollow-core cross-laminated timber (HCCLT). The
          performance-driven design workflow leverages the MR technology and tiling automation of
          nonuniform wood boards to guide material processing and fabrication of a customized HCCLT
          prototype. This paper proposes to expand the usage and the viability of customized HCCLT as
          a structural component. Upcycling locally salvaged wood elements, the prototype develops a
          material language of lamination that peels away in calibrated gradients to generate structural
          and visual porosity. By engaging with the computational environment and the physical making
          process through the MR workflow, users are able to explore an accessible design streamline.</p>
          
        <p>To test this hybridized design approach, the paper investigates the following objectives: 1) utilize
          locally sourced salvaged wood boards in response to the emerging deconstruction practice to
          minimize material waste; 2) leverage MR-aided process for the utilization of nonuniform wood
          materials and the fabrication of prototypes; 3) implement design parameters such as structural
          and program requirements for customization; 4) develop a semiautomated wood board
          packing protocol for nonuniform materials; and 5) propose a performance-driven load-bearing
          HCCLT wall at housing scale as a further step of architectural application. This MR-informed
          process facilitates the reuse of discarded wood wastes for the customized HCCLT assembly
          and provides an intuitive workflow for expert and nonexpert users.</p>

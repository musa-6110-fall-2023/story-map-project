        <p><b>NeoBrick</b> is a 3D clay-printed brick prototype
          that explores generative design processes
          coupled with environmental inputs as design
          drivers. Maintaining indoor thermal comfort
          by utilizing a passive cooling strategy contributes
          to energy efficiency and healthy
          indoor air environment in a specific climatic
          context such as tropical climate zones. In this
          aspect, clay is a locally accessible material
          that brings thermal benefits for cooling due to
          the low heat conductivity. Moreover, environmental
          simulations and additive manufacturing
          techniques are emerging as key drivers for
          designing and testing a performance-driven
          architectural systems. <b><i>This paper introduces
          an integrated research workflow that develops
          a Triply Periodic Minimal Surface (TPMS)-
          informed clay-printed brick system. The brick
          geometries are informed by environmental
          feedback including airflow and heat transfer
          performance. </i></b>To articulate this environmentally
          performing clay brick prototype, first,
          this research leverages computational fluid
          dynamics (CFD) and heat transfer analysis to
          inform and evaluate brick geometries. Second,
          the research utilizes an additive manufacturing
          technology with customized toolpaths for
          fabricating non-standard brick geometries.
          Lastly, the research delivers a possible residential
          architectural application in a specific
          climate condition, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam,
          to suggest a possible adaptation of the
          passive ventilation system for enhancing the
          thermal environment and energy efficiency.</p>

        <p>HoloWall is a wall assembly that integrates mixed reality (MR) protocols with nonuniformly
          sized lumber to develop a customized hollow-core cross-laminated timber (HCCLT). The
          performance-driven design workflow leverages the MR technology and tiling automation of
          nonuniform wood boards to guide material processing and fabrication of a customized HCCLT
          prototype. This paper proposes to expand the usage and the viability of customized HCCLT as
          a structural component. Upcycling locally salvaged wood elements, the prototype develops a
          material language of lamination that peels away in calibrated gradients to generate structural
          and visual porosity. By engaging with the computational environment and the physical making
          process through the MR workflow, users are able to explore an accessible design streamline.</p>
          
        <p>To test this hybridized design approach, the paper investigates the following objectives: 1) utilize
          locally sourced salvaged wood boards in response to the emerging deconstruction practice to
          minimize material waste; 2) leverage MR-aided process for the utilization of nonuniform wood
          materials and the fabrication of prototypes; 3) implement design parameters such as structural
          and program requirements for customization; 4) develop a semiautomated wood board
          packing protocol for nonuniform materials; and 5) propose a performance-driven load-bearing
          HCCLT wall at housing scale as a further step of architectural application. This MR-informed
          process facilitates the reuse of discarded wood wastes for the customized HCCLT assembly
          and provides an intuitive workflow for expert and nonexpert users.</p>

        <p>
          Timber De-Standardized 2.0 is a mixed reality (MR) user interface (UI) that utilizes 
          timber waste produced by manufacturing dimensional lumber, suggesting an expanded 
          notion for “material usability” in timber construction. The expanded notion of designing 
          with discarded logs not only requires new tools and technologies for cataloguing, 
          structuring, and fabricating. It also relies on new methods and platforms for 
          the visualization and design of these structures. As a MR UI, Timber De-Standardized 
          enables professionals and non-professionals alike to seamlessly design with irregular 
          logs and to create viable structural systems using an intuitive MR environment. 
          In order to develop a MR environment with this level of competency, the research aims 
          to finesse the visualization techniques in the immersive full-scale 3D environment 
          and to minimize the use of alternative 2D UI(s). The research methodology focuses 
          on (1) cataloguing and extracting basic properties of various tree logs, 
          (2) refining mesh visualization for better user interaction, and (3) developing 
          the MR UI to increase user design agency with custom menu lists and operations. 
          This methodology will extend the usability of MR UI protocols to a broader audience 
          while democratizing design and enabling the user as co-creator.

          The goal of this research is to design and fabricate a modular living wall brick system 
          that purifies and cools air for various indoor environments. The research utilizes 
          ceramic 3d printing techniques for fabrication; and living plants in conjunction 
          with evaporative cooling techniques for indoor air quality control. The brick is 
          made of soil which become porous after firing or drying. Water from the reservoirs 
          slowly weep through the porous brick, creating a layer of water on the surface of 
          the brick. The air movement around the saturated brick creates evaporative cooling 
          and the hydro-seeded plants absorb water from the surface. The shape and texture of 
          the Weeping Brick maximizes the cooling effect via large surface area. As an 
          aggregated wall system, the water circulates from unit to unit by gravity through 
          interconnected reservoirs embedded within each unit. The plants and moss transform 
          the Weeping Brick into a living wall system, purifying and conditioning the indoor air.
